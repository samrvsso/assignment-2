<h2>Introduction</h2>

A planet is a <em>celestial</em> body, orbiting a star, that is massive enough to be gravitationally <em>rounded</em> and has “cleared the neighbourhood” around its orbit.

“I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier.”
— Neil Degrasse Tyson

<em>Unfortunately</em>, Pluto is no longer a planet but a dwarf planet. Sometimes I think, Pluto still deserves full <em>planet hood</em>.

Mars is named after the Roman god of war, it is often described as the “Red Planet” because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.
